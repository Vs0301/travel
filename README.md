Project Description: 
Travell website, as described above , can lead to error free, secure, reliable 
and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their 
other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help 
organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can 
maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that 
one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being 
able to reach the information 
The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of 
computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their 
requirement, so that their valuable data/information  can be stored for a 
longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. Basically 
the project describes how to manage for good performance and better 
services for the clients 
Core Azure Services: 
1. Azure Blob storage:It is Microsoft's object storage solution for the 
cloud. Blob storage is optimi zed for storing a massive amount of 
unstructured data, such as text or binary data. 
o It serves images or documents directly to a browser. 
o It stores files for distributed acce 
o We can stream video and audio using blob storage. 
o Easy writing to log files. 
o It stores the data for backup, restore, disaster recovery, and archiving. 
2. Azure storage account: A storage account is a container that bands 
a set of Azure Storage services together. Only data services from 
Azure Storage can be comprised in a storage account. Integrating 
data services into a storage account allows the user to manage them 
as a group. The settings specified while creating the account, or 
setting that is changed after creation, is applicable everywhere. Once 
the storage account gets deleted, all the data stored inside gets 
removed. 
Azure AI Service: 
Azure Bot Service, part of Microsoft Azure, is a platform for building, 
deploying, and managing chatbots across various channels, like websites, 
mobile apps, Microsoft Teams, and more. It provides tools and services to 
create intelligent bots that can interact with users through natural language. 
Key Features 
Bot Framework SDK: This is a software development kit that enables you 
to build bots using .NET, JavaScript, or Python. It provides pre-built 
models and templates, as well as tools for dialog management, 
integration, and more. 
Azure Bot Service: This is the managed service that handles the 
infrastructure, scaling, and integration of bots. It integrates seamlessly 
with other Azure services like Azure Cognitive Services for adding AI 
capabilities. 
Azure Cognitive Services Integration: With services like Language 
Understanding (LUIS) and Azure Cognitive Services for Language, you 
can enhance bots with natural language processing, sentiment analysis, 
translation, and other AI features. 
Multi-Channel Support: Bots can be deployed to multiple platforms, such 
as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and custom web 
applications. Azure Bot Service provides a central place to manage and 
configure these channels. 
Bot Framework Composer: A visual authoring tool that makes it easier to 
design and develop bots with a drag-and-drop interface. It helps you 
define dialogs, manage conversation flows, and integrate with external 
services without heavy coding. 
Azure Bot Emulator: A desktop application that allows you to test and 
debug bots locally before deploying them to Azure. It provides a 
simulation environment for chatbot conversations.
